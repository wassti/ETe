# ETe

This is a modern Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory engine aimed to be fast, secure and compatible with many existing ET mods and etmain.
It is based on the Quake3e engine which itself is based on the last non-SDL source dump of ioquake3 with latest upstream fixes applied. Several common fixes from upstream [ET:Legacy](https://github.com/etlegacy/etlegacy) also are applied as needed for security.

*This repository does not contains any game content so in order to play you must copy resulting binaries into your existing Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory installation*

**Key features**:

* optimized OpenGL renderer
* ~~optimized Vulkan renderer~~ **NOT YET**
* raw mouse input support, enabled automatically instead of DirectInput(**\in_mouse 1**) if available
* unlagged mouse events processing, can be reverted by setting **\in_lagged 1**
* **\in_minimize** - hotkey for minimize/restore main window (win32-only, direct replacement for Q3Minimizer)
* **\video-pipe** - to use external ffmpeg binary as an encoder for better quality and smaller output files
* improved server-side DoS protection, much reduced memory usage
* raised filesystem limits (up to 20,000 maps can be handled in a single directory)
* reworked Zone memory allocator, no more out-of-memory errors
* non-intrusive support for SDL2 backend (video,audio,input), selectable at compile time for *nix via CMake
* tons of bugfixes and other improvements
* basic Discord Rich Presence support (win32-only currently, linux support to follow when 64-bit support is ready)

## Vulkan renderer

***NOT YET AVAILABLE***

## OpenGL renderer

Based on classic OpenGL renderers from id/ioq3/cnq3/openarena, features:

* OpenGL 1.1 compatible, uses features from newer versions whenever available
* high-quality per-pixel dynamic lighting, can be triggered by **\r_dlightMode** cvar
* ~~merged lightmaps (atlases)~~
* static world surfaces cached in VBO (**\r_vbo 1**)
* offscreen rendering, enabled with **\r_fbo 1**, all following requires it enabled:
* `screenMap` texture rendering - to create realistic environment reflections
* multi-sample anti-aliasing (**\r_ext_multisample**)
* per-window gamma-correction which is important for screen-capture tools like OBS
* you can minimize game window any time during **\video**|**\video-pipe** recording
* high dynamic range render targets (**\r_hdr 1**) to avoid color banding
* bloom post-processing effect
* arbitrary resolution rendering
* greyscale mode
* supersample anti-aliasing (**\r_ext_supersample**)

Performance is usually greater or equal to other opengl1 renderers

## OpenGL2 renderer

Original ioquake3 renderer, not available and unlikely to be ported


## Missing ioquake3 features

* OpenAL(-soft) support
* VoIP support (probably never going to add since Discord etc)
* Extra sound codecs like ogg and opus

## Build Instructions

### windows/msvc 

Install Visual Studio Community Edition 2017 or later and compile all projects from solution

`src/wolf.sln`

Default settings are using Visual Studio 2017 with XP compatible toolset

Only 32-bit binaries compatible until 64-bit mods become available and a 64-bit etmain is available

Copy resulting exe from `src/[Debug|Release]` directory and `src/ded/[Debug|Release]` directory

~~To compile with Vulkan backend - clean solution, right click on `wolf` project, find `Project Dependencies` and select `renderervk` instead of `renderer`~~

### ~~windows/mingw~~

WIP

~~All build dependencies (libraries, headers) are bundled-in~~

~~Build with either `make ARCH=x86` or `make ARCH=x86_64` commands depending from your target system, then copy resulting binaries from created `build` directory or use command:~~

~~`make install DESTDIR=<path_to_game_files>`~~

### linux

Debian based distros:
```
cd src
./linux_build.sh
```

Build artifacts ete.x86 and ete-ded.x86 are then found under the build directory.

Only 32-bit binaries compatible until 64-bit mods become available and a 64-bit etmain is available

The provided 32-bit cross compile toolchain is provided on this repository.

Several options available for linux builds with CMake:

`BUILD_CLIENT=ON` - build unified client/server executable, enabled by default

`BUILD_DEDSERVER=ON` - build dedicated server executable, enabled by default

`USE_SDL2=OFF` - use SDL2 backend for video, audio, input subsystems, disabled by default but recommended

`USE_SYSTEM_JPEG=ON` - use current system JPEG-turbo library, enabled by default

### macOS

**UNSUPPORTED** Patches and pull requests welcome
